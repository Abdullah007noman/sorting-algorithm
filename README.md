# sorting-algorithm
This repository contains implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Selection Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in Python and is accompanied by a brief explanation of how it works.
## 1. Insertion Sort
Description:
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element from the input and inserts it into its correct position in the already-sorted part of the array.

Time Complexity:
Worst-case: O(nÂ²)

Best-case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)

Average-case: O(nÂ²)
## Usage
``` python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr
    ```
